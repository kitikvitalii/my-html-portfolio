<h3>My top 3 movies of all-time</h3>
<hr/>
<h3>Gran Turismo</h3>

<p>  Yann Mardenborough, an avid gamer from Cardiff, spends his days playing Gran  Turismo,refusing to succeed in the
    real world. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Danny, a marketing manager for the Nissan Motor Corporation, is running an
    advertising campaign and working with the Gran Turismo management team on a plan to launch a competition inviting
    gamers to try their luck with real racing cars.
</p>
<p> Needing help in organising the event, Danny turns to Jack, a former
    racing driver and incorrigible cynic. When fate brings Yann together with Danny and Jack, the gamer becomes a driver
    of a Nissan racing car, plunging headlong into the struggle for a place under the sun in the competitive world of
    real racing.

<h3>Dovbush: Lord of Black Mountains</h3>

<p>Carpathians. Early 18th century. The brutal rule of the Polish nobility forces the Hutsuls to flee to the mountains.
        Two brothers, Oleksa and Ivan Dovbusha, are outlawed and become oprishki.
        Seeking revenge against the lords for the murder of Dovbusha's parents, the brothers become enemies of each other.
        One seeks money, the other justice.
</p>
    
<p>The Hutsuls start an uprising led by Oleksa. The gentry does everything possible to destroy Dovbush. But he outwits
        them. And the legend of the Carpathian knight grew. A legend that inspires the generation of those fighting for the
        freedom of their native land. About Oleksa Dovbush's strength and love, about treason and injustice. About how he
        lived and how he cheated death.
</p>

<h3>The Boat</h3>
<p>
    Three young couples decide to spend an unforgettable weekend on a luxury yacht. But the long-awaited cruise quickly turns into a real nightmare for them. After the party they wake up in the middle of the sea and discover that the food and water on the yacht have disappeared. At the same time they hear an unknown voice on the radio, which starts a blood-chilling psychological game.
